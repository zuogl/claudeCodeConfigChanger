# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is currently an empty project directory. As the project develops, this file should be updated with:

1. **Build and Development Commands**: Once a build system is established, document the commands for:
   - Building the project
   - Running tests
   - Linting/formatting code
   - Running the application

2. **Architecture Overview**: As the codebase grows, document:
   - Main architectural patterns used
   - Key dependencies and their purposes
   - Important design decisions that affect the entire codebase

Please update this file as the project evolves to help future Claude Code instances understand the codebase structure and development workflow.
